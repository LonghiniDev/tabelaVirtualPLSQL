### Exercism exercises in Oracle PL/SQL

# Setup
### You'll need access to a mounted Oracle DB. If you don't have one already installed, here are a few options:

- Download VirtualBox from Oracle and run one of the freely available images; at the time of writing, the easiest to get started with at the time of writing might be *Database App Development VM.*
- Download and install the a version of the Oracle DB itself. Developer licenses are free.

To work on individual problems, a nice and free way is to use SQL Developer. If you don't want to use yet another IDE, you can simply copy and paste your code into a terminal / command prompt connected to the database. The files are prepared in a way that will simply overwrite the previously compiled version.
